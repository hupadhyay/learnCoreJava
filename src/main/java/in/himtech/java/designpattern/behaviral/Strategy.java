 * In strategy design pattern, The class or object change its behavior at
 * runtime based on the data/scenario. The best example to this pattern is that
 * we have a set of sorting algorithms. Some algorithm works best when dataset
 * is small and some are works good when the datasetÂ is large and some are on
 * other scenario.
